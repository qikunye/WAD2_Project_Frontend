      <p class="home-description">
        According to the statistics, a significant amount of food wastage comes from households, where people often overbuy,
        forget what they have at home, or struggle to use up ingredients before they spoil. When dietary restrictions are
        involved, meal planning becomes even more challenging which leads to edible food being thrown away instead of enjoyed.
